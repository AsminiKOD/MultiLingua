Welcome to MultiLingua Knowledge Base.

MultiLingua is a project designed to help users translate and query information across multiple languages using AI-powered language models.

Key Features:
- Language Detection and Translation using Google Translate API.
- Question Answering over custom documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Support for multi-language queries and answers.

The project uses LangChain, OpenAI models like GPT-3.5/4, and vector databases for semantic search.

Example Use Cases:
1. Translate a question from Spanish and retrieve the correct English answer.
2. Answer a French query about a company policy based on internal documents.
3. Provide multilingual support for customer service agents.

This system bridges the gap between languages for enterprise knowledge bases.
